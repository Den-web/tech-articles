# OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities: A Guide for Developers

## Introduction
The **OWASP Top 10** is a standard awareness document for developers and security professionals, highlighting the most critical security risks in web applications. Understanding these vulnerabilities is essential for building secure applications and protecting sensitive data.

This article covers the **OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities**, how they work, examples, and best practices to mitigate them.

## OWASP Top 10 Evolution: 2017 vs. 2021
Below is a comparison of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities from 2017 to 2021, showcasing the changes and newly introduced risks:

The key changes include:
- **Injection attacks** remain a critical threat but have been categorized under **A03:2021 - Injection**.
- **Broken Authentication** has been expanded into **A07:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures**.
- **Cryptographic Failures** replace **Sensitive Data Exposure**, emphasizing the importance of encryption and data protection.
- **Insecure Design (A04:2021)** is a new category focusing on the root causes of security weaknesses.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** has been newly added due to its increasing impact.

## 1. Broken Access Control (A01:2021)
### Overview
Broken Access Control occurs when users can perform actions outside their intended permissions, such as accessing unauthorized data or modifying admin-level configurations.

### Example
A normal user is able to access an admin-only endpoint by modifying the URL:
```
https://example.com/admin/dashboard
```

### Mitigation
- Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)**.
- Enforce **server-side authorization** for each request.
- Use **least privilege principles** for user roles.

---
## 2. Cryptographic Failures (A02:2021)
### Overview
Sensitive data exposure happens when an application does not properly protect data, leading to unauthorized access or leaks.

### Example
- Storing passwords in plaintext instead of hashing them.
- Exposing API keys or credentials in frontend JavaScript files.

### Mitigation
- Use strong **encryption algorithms** (AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.2+ for data in transit).
- Never store sensitive data in **local storage or cookies**.
- Implement **secure password hashing** (Argon2, PBKDF2, bcrypt).

---
## 3. Injection (A03:2021)
### Overview
Injection attacks occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter (SQL, NoSQL, OS commands, etc.), leading to unauthorized command execution.

### Example
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR '1'='1';
```

### Mitigation
- Use **prepared statements and parameterized queries**.
- Implement **input validation**.
- Use an **ORM (Object-Relational Mapper)** to avoid direct database queries.

---
## 4. Insecure Design (A04:2021)
### Overview
Insecure design focuses on weaknesses in the application architecture that lead to security risks.

### Example
- Not implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin users.
- Allowing unlimited login attempts without rate limiting.

### Mitigation
- Conduct **threat modeling** and security design reviews.
- Use **secure development life cycle (SDLC)** practices.
- Apply **principle of least privilege** from the design phase.

---
## 5. Security Misconfiguration (A05:2021)
### Overview
Security misconfiguration happens when applications, servers, or databases have default settings, unnecessary features enabled, or incorrect security policies.

### Example
- Using default admin credentials (e.g., `admin:admin`).
- Exposing stack traces and debug information in production.

### Mitigation
- Disable **debug mode** in production.
- Regularly update software and dependencies.
- Apply **security headers** (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options).

---
## 6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components (A06:2021)
### Overview
Using outdated libraries, frameworks, or software can introduce known vulnerabilities.

### Example
- Running an old version of **jQuery** with known XSS vulnerabilities.
- Using a framework version with known security issues.

### Mitigation
- Keep all dependencies **updated**.
- Regularly monitor for **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**.
- Use **SCA (Software Composition Analysis) tools**.

---
## 7. Identification and Authentication Failures (A07:2021)
### Overview
Improper authentication mechanisms allow attackers to impersonate users or bypass login protections.

### Example
- Weak password policies allowing short or common passwords.
- Not implementing session timeouts or MFA.

### Mitigation
- Use **strong authentication mechanisms** (OAuth, OpenID Connect).
- Implement **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.
- Use secure **session management** practices.

---
## 8. Software and Data Integrity Failures (A08:2021)
### Overview
This vulnerability includes insecure deserialization, dependency confusion, and software supply chain attacks.

### Example
- A package manager downloads an outdated or malicious dependency.
- Unvalidated data is deserialized, leading to RCE (Remote Code Execution).

### Mitigation
- Use **digital signatures** for software integrity.
- Validate all **third-party dependencies**.
- Implement **code integrity checks**.

---
## 9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures (A09:2021)
### Overview
Lack of proper logging and monitoring makes it difficult to detect and respond to security incidents.

### Example
- No logs for failed login attempts.
- Logs stored in plaintext without encryption.

### Mitigation
- Implement **centralized logging**.
- Monitor logs for **anomalous activity**.
- Use **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools**.

---
## 10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (A10:2021)
### Overview
SSRF occurs when an attacker can force a server to make HTTP requests to unintended locations, potentially accessing internal services.

### Example
```http
GET /fetch?url=http://localhost:8080/admin
```

### Mitigation
- Implement **allowlists** for outbound requests.
- Restrict requests to **internal resources**.
- Use **firewalls and network segmentation**.

---
## Conclusion
Understanding and mitigating these OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities is crucial for securing modern web applications. By implementing best practices, regular security audits, and secure coding standards, developers can reduce risks and build robust applications.
