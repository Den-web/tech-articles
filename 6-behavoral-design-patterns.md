# **Behavioral Design Patterns in React: Practical Use Cases and Comparisons**

## **Introduction**
Behavioral design patterns focus on managing communication and interaction between objects in a system. In React, these patterns are especially useful for managing **component interactions**, **state transitions**, and **data flow** in a scalable and maintainable way.

This article explores **Behavioral Patterns** and how they can be implemented in React applications. We’ll cover **Observer**, **Strategy**, **Command**, **State**, and **Mediator** patterns with practical examples.

---

## **1. Observer Pattern** – 🔔 *Reacting to Changes in State*
### **What It Does**
The **Observer Pattern** establishes a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about changes in state. In React, this is commonly used for event handling or state updates.

### **Example: Observer Pattern for State Changes**
```tsx
// Observable object
const createStore = () => {
  let state = {};
  const listeners = [];

  return {
    subscribe: (listener) => listeners.push(listener),
    setState: (newState) => {
      state = { ...state, ...newState };
      listeners.forEach((listener) => listener(state));
    },
    getState: () => state,
  };
};

// Usage
const store = createStore();

store.subscribe((state) => console.log("State updated:", state));
store.setState({ user: "John Doe" }); // Logs: State updated: { user: "John Doe" }
```

### **When to Use It**
- **Redux**: Used in the `connect` function to observe store updates.
- **Event Systems**: Reacting to custom events in components.

---

## **2. Strategy Pattern** – 🎯 *Dynamic Component Behavior*
### **What It Does**
The **Strategy Pattern** defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable. In React, this is useful for implementing dynamic behavior based on props or context.

### **Example: Strategy for Dynamic Sorting**
```tsx
const strategies = {
  ascending: (a, b) => a - b,
  descending: (a, b) => b - a,
};

const SortList = ({ items, strategy }) => {
  const sortedItems = [...items].sort(strategies[strategy]);
  return <ul>{sortedItems.map((item) => <li key={item}>{item}</li>)}</ul>;
};

// Usage
<SortList items={[3, 1, 4, 1]} strategy="ascending" />;
```

### **When to Use It**
- Implementing **dynamic sorting**, filtering, or rendering strategies.

---

## **3. Command Pattern** – 💡 *Encapsulating User Actions*
### **What It Does**
The **Command Pattern** encapsulates actions as objects, allowing them to be stored, passed, and executed later. This is ideal for managing undo/redo functionality in React.

### **Example: Command Pattern for Undo/Redo**
```tsx
const commands = [];
let currentState = "";

const execute = (command) => {
  commands.push(command);
  currentState = command.execute(currentState);
};

const undo = () => {
  const command = commands.pop();
  currentState = command.undo(currentState);
};

const command = {
  execute: (state) => `${state} Command executed.`,
  undo: (state) => state.replace(" Command executed.", ""),
};

execute(command);
console.log(currentState); // " Command executed."
undo();
console.log(currentState); // ""
```

### **When to Use It**
- Managing **complex user actions** with undo/redo capabilities.
- Handling **macro commands** in user workflows.

---

## **4. State Pattern** – 🌀 *Dynamic State Transitions*
### **What It Does**
The **State Pattern** allows an object to change its behavior based on its internal state. In React, this can be used to handle state-dependent component behavior.

### **Example: State Management in a Toggle Component**
```tsx
const ToggleButton = () => {
  const [state, setState] = useState("off");

  const toggleState = () => {
    setState((prev) => (prev === "off" ? "on" : "off"));
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={toggleState}>
      {state === "off" ? "Turn On" : "Turn Off"}
    </button>
  );
};
```

### **When to Use It**
- Handling **state transitions** in components, such as toggles or wizards.
- Managing **stateful logic** in forms or modals.

---

## **5. Mediator Pattern** – 🤝 *Centralizing Component Communication*
### **What It Does**
The **Mediator Pattern** centralizes communication between components to reduce coupling. In React, this is often implemented using a **Context API**.

### **Example: Mediator Pattern with Context API**
```tsx
const ChatContext = createContext();

const ChatProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);

  const sendMessage = (message) => {
    setMessages((prev) => [...prev, message]);
  };

  return (
    <ChatContext.Provider value={{ messages, sendMessage }}>
      {children}
    </ChatContext.Provider>
  );
};

const ChatWindow = () => {
  const { messages } = useContext(ChatContext);
  return <ul>{messages.map((msg, idx) => <li key={idx}>{msg}</li>)}</ul>;
};

const ChatInput = () => {
  const { sendMessage } = useContext(ChatContext);
  const [input, setInput] = useState("");

  const handleSend = () => {
    sendMessage(input);
    setInput("");
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input value={input} onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={handleSend}>Send</button>
    </div>
  );
};

// Usage
const App = () => (
  <ChatProvider>
    <ChatWindow />
    <ChatInput />
  </ChatProvider>
);
```

### **When to Use It**
- Centralizing **component communication** in complex forms or chat applications.
- Reducing **coupling** between components.
