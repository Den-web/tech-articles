# **3 Types of Design Patterns Every Developer Should Know**

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They provide a structured way to write clean, reusable, and scalable code. There are **three main types of design patterns**: **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral**.

## **Overview of Design Patterns**
1. **Creational Patterns**: Focus on how objects are created, ensuring flexibility and efficiency.  
   - *Examples*: Singleton, Factory.

2. **Structural Patterns**: Simplify relationships between objects, making systems easier to manage.  
   - *Examples*: Facade, Adapter.

3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Handle communication between objects to ensure smooth workflows.  
   - *Examples*: Strategy, Observer.

## **Pros of Using Design Patterns**
- **Reusability**: Patterns provide tried-and-tested solutions that save time.
- **Maintainability**: Simplified and organized code is easier to debug and extend.
- **Scalability**: Patterns enable building systems that handle growth effectively.
- **Team Collaboration**: A shared understanding of patterns improves teamwork.

## **Cons of Using Design Patterns**
- **Overhead**: Implementing patterns can add unnecessary complexity if not needed.
- **Learning Curve**: Understanding when and how to use patterns requires experience.
- **Not One-Size-Fits-All**: Patterns must be tailored to fit specific scenarios.
